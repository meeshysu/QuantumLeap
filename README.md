# QuantumLeap

This exercise is based off of the show Quantum Leap. In this you will see data collected in C# and Sql, where the information of the Leaper, the Leapee, the Event and the Budget are presented. You can keep up with Sam Buckett, if you wish, or some of the other Leapers. This is supposed to be a top secret project, so I emplore you, keep this between us.


# To run this project 

- You will need to clone my repo using your favorite terminal. 
- After you have done so, you will need to use Postman or Insomnia (or whatever API development environment you choose).
- Run this project and catch the local host URL that appears in the webpage. 
- In your postman, paste that in the appropriate URL slot, then based off of my URLS in C#, apply. Example:
``` https://localhost:44327/api/event ``` ! Do not forget to use the GET, POST, or UPDATE selection based on what you are trying to procure before sending off the request.

If you are curious about the SQL data retrieval, feel free to copy and paste the SQL queries that have been added to the project as well. Some of these may retrieve more information that what was put into the C# project. :)
